MT Homework 3

3/14 - First commit, pushed output of default decoder to github.
3/26 - Made a program to generate hypotheses for A* search.
3/30 - Made a beam-search stack decoder in Java that allows for reordering, does recombination, and uses histogram pruning.
3/31 - Tested various reorderings and histogram pruning sizes.
4/1 - Realized two mistakes: (1) recombination was being done incorrectly, fixed this; (2) decoder was greedy, fixed this by we calculating future cost.
4/2 - Gave up on Java decoder, edited given python "decode" to pass baseline.
