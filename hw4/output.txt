mexican president 's sister , apparently , lost the election in michoacan
president felipe calderon 's sister , it seems , has made its bid for the governor 's seat michoacan during the fierce state election , and she said on monday that the traffickers have helped to tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents .
" interference by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not only for the michoacan , but also for the whole country , " said luisa maria calderon in радиоинтервью on the day sunday after the vote .
pri ruled mexico for seven decades , until she lost the presidency in 2000 .
calderon , national action party candidate , or ipa , headed by her brother , refused to acknowledge вальехо winner .
ауреолес also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
in michoacan has long dominated drug cartels , in marijuana , heroin and метамфетаминах .
for the pri , however , no matter how badly looked elections in michoacan , victory will give momentum behind the party .
раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must do " everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia can be protected to some extent , but it cannot be invulnerable . "
european monetary union was badly undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he could bring the world economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can , " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and decline in foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .
" at some point they recognize that greeks are retiring at the age of 50 and ride holidays to the sea , and it will not be perceived well , " he said .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields battlefield in afghanistan on the line and civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong decline , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine the credibility of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness " .
" while foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff would be reduced , which will lead to опозданиям staff with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequences of sequestration in the department of defense will be a rapid decline in the united states as a leading global military power . "
" this is not an option , with which we live , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to pentagon budget compromise or inflame calls for release from cutbacks , see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with a shell , but without the core .
" with this paper tiger , the army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , can accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense project may encounter obstacles , including those that passed the tests , and some only on the early stages of planning .
ending further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that is a vital next step to improve and address potential threats china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on exams in school and college is the norm .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in a single day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not from this hard to notice and it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complex question completely .
someone can use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

why do you constantly change the words in the yellow ledbetter at concerts ?
he sings it , and i think , he uses the first thing that comes into his head .
they are so many that i can talk all day about басистах , which i love .
i think we all feel some оторванность from the word гранж .
at first , your music was more grim , and now it has become more positive .
this is interesting , because , i think , there are several songs on this album , which may seem easier , but there are songs such as the end or just breathe , which are considered very grim , though they may sound a bit positive .
i think that when you grow , and in your life has been some injury and you lost family member or friend , these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music , and these two songs , of course , reflect this for me .

рафаель эррера , a researcher at the department of chemical , unam , developed a polymer - modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable to the impact of environmental and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , said that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition both at high , and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his характерное вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , but change throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperatures , specializing in chemical engineering said .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
when vehicles and прикладывании efforts , it helps forces of very well be on the road to cover .
the асфальтовом cover , he added , is the last layer , called a layer of wear , which is made of small stone , in fact sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , wear also requires the proper thickness , and must be taken into account material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water into coverage and it 's impossible to leave , it raises размягчение all sectors of the cover , and therefore education yam .
also a member of the national researchers explained that the transport system load is another important factor in the formation of holes , and therefore the thickness of each layer should always be connected to cover transport load and need to ensure this requirement , to prevent frequent appearance of the pits .

but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , had to " create a " republican .
